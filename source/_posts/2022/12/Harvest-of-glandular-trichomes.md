1. Apices with a size of 1–2 cm from 2 to 4 months old plants were collected into a 250 ml glass bottle containing cold isolation buffer **(200 mM sorbitol, 50 mM TrisHCl, 20 mM sucrose, 10 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2,5mM succinic acid, 1 mM EGTA and 0.5 mM K2HPO4)** and 15 g of 0.75–1 mm **glass beads**.
2. Type VI glands were isolated by shaking the bottle by hand for 2 min.
3. Afterwards the material was filtered through two steel sieves of 150 and 63 μm meshes respectively to remove apices and glass beads.
4. Finally the heads of the type VI trichomes were collected onto a 25 μm mesh steal sieve washed with the isolation buffer and concentrated by a short centrifugation.
